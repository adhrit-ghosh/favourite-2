        <p>My favourite hobby is reading books. I like to read as it is really fun for me and I like to read funny and knowledgeble books.Reading books has many benefits such as it helps with your vocabluary and it helps with your thinking process. I am 10 years old and in sixth grade and I love to read.Reading is a good source of fun,entertainment and inspiration.Whenever i read any book, I get lost in the moment and read until I finish the whole story.</p>
